# JakkedWeb

`JakkedWeb` was the former business website for Jakked Hardcore Gym in Montgomery, IL.  This repository
does not contain the DB schema or any of the images, videos, or other assets
used by the site, and is intended to serve as a code example for myself and a
project example for [the JHFrame framework](https://github.com/rakelley/jhframe)
that powers it.


## Installation and Use
This version of JakkedWeb is intentionally not usable in its current form as it
lacks the database and necessary assets.  You can however install its
dependencies via Composer and run the test suite.
